This project combined real-time detection with geospatial tracking, helping prioritize cleanup efforts and analyze bicycle usage patterns. \n \n Our team implemented an OpenCV object detection model with a 100% accuracy (so far!) in bicycle identification! Once the project is done, we plan on providing its insights to campus authorities for bike cleanups!",
